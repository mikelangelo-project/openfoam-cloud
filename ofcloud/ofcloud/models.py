    An instance can be in one of the following states:
    PENDING - waiting for the scheduler to start preparing case files and then start this instance
    DEPLOYING - instance is in deployament procedure, preparing case files, starting instance, mounting nfs, etc.
    UP - instance VM is UP, but still not configured completely (usually needs ENV variables set, floating_ip 
        assigned, etc.)
    READY - instance is UP and its environment configured and ready for calculation/decomposition
    DECOMPOSING - instance is running `decomposePar` which prepares case files for multi threaded execution. Only 
        instances running on a flavor with multiple VCPUs can be in this state
    RUNNING - instance VM is executing OpenFOAM calculation on a single thread. Usually instances with only one VCPU 
        will be in this state, but in case we can not retrieve instance info on VCPUs even multi-VCPU instances can be 
        in this state
    RUNNING_MPI - instance VM is executing OpenFOAM calculation via the `mpirun` command (multi threaded execution).
        Only multi-VCPU instances can be in this state.
    RECONSTRUCTING - instance VM is executing OpenFOAMs `reconstructPar` command. Only multi-VCPU instances who ran the 
        simulation calculation via the `mpirun` command can be in this state.
    COMPLETE - simulation calculation is complete and was successful
    FAILED - simulation calculation failed. See logs for more info
